# Predict an Author with a Simple Neural Network

A compact authorship-attribution project using a simple neural network classifier.

## What I did
- Prepared text data into features suitable for a neural network
- Trained a lightweight feed-forward model to predict the author of a passage
- Evaluated performance and iterated on preprocessing / hyperparameters

## Tech
Python, neural networks (introductory), text preprocessing
