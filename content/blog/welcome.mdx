Hi — I’m **Varsha Rajesh**. This site is my living notebook: project breakdowns, lessons learned, and small write-ups from building data products end-to-end.

What I’m optimizing for:

- **Clear problem statements**
- **Reproducible results**
- **Readable code + clean visuals**
- **Shipping** (a demo link, not just a repo)

If you’re a recruiter or teammate: start at **Projects**.
